    <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                <h4><li>Marinate the Goat:</li></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combine the goat meat, yogurt, and salt in a bowl. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><li>Cook the Base:</li></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the whole cloves and cinnamon stick and fry for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onions and saut√© until softened and golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                </ul>
                    <h4><li>Add the Spices:</li></h4>

                        <li>Add the coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder and garam masala. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><li>Sear the Goat:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the marinated goat meat to the pot and brown it on all sides over medium-high heat, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><li>Simmer and Tenderize:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add 1 cup of water (or enough to partially submerge the meat). 
                            Bring to a simmer, cover the pot, and cook over low heat for 1-1.5 hours, or until the goat meat is tender. 
                            Check occasionally and add more water if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><li>Finish and Serve:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taste and adjust the salt and spices as needed. If the gravy is too thin, simmer uncovered for a few minutes to thicken it.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with rice, naan, or roti.</li>
                    </ul>

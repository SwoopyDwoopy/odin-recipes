    <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                <h4><li>Prep the Beans:</li></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drain the soaked kidney beans and rinse thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>In a pressure cooker or large pot, add the kidney beans and enough fresh water to cover them by about 2 inches. Add a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>Pressure cook on high for 15-20 minutes (or until the beans are soft). If using a regular pot, simmer for 45-60 minutes or until tender.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><li>Make the Masala Base:</li></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the beans cook, heat the oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onions and saut√© until softened and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                </ul>
                    <h4><li>Spice it Up:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala to the onion mixture. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.</li>
                        <li>Add the tomato puree and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are well cooked and the oil starts to separate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><li>Combine and Simmer:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add the cooked kidney beans along with some of their cooking liquid to the tomato masala. Adjust the consistency with water if needed.</li>
                        <li>Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the flavors have blended and the gravy has thickened slightly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><li>Finish and Serve:</li></h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taste and adjust the salt and spices as needed.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve hot with rice, naan, or roti.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
